# Design Systems Week 2024

<Paragraph lead>
    From 14 to 17 October, NL Design System organises the 4th edition of Design Systems Week. Join us for short talks about the how and why of design systems, from managing design systems to user research and accessibility. This year there will be talks both in Dutch and English.
</Paragraph>

## Program

These are all sessions that will be in English.

All sessions can be joined online for free. Each talk will take about 30 minutes, including time for questions.

<DSWSession title="Using USWDS Accessibility Tests to Develop Accessibility Skills Across Government Teams" speakers={[speakers.AmyCole]} organisation="US Web Design System">

Amy will share plain-language accessibility tests the USWDS team has created for checking the accessibility of individual components. Attendees will learn how any web team — technical or not — can use these tests to perform baseline manual accessibility testing (like keyboard, screen reader, mobile, and zoom magnification testing) on their own sites. She will also describe the team’s iterative design and development process for these checklists, and how other teams can develop their owns.

</DSWSession>

<DSWSession title="Design Systems: Choose your own adventure" speakers={[speakers.GeriReid]} organisation="Just Eat Takeaway">

Join Geri, a seasoned design systems explorer with 8 years of adventures under her belt, as she navigates the uncharted territories of accessibility in a major product org. With no playbook in hand, Geri’s quest is one we can all relate to: figuring it out as we go along.

In this ‘choose your own adventure’ session, you’ll discover how the principles of design systems can illuminate a path through any new challenge. Come prepared to laugh, learn, and maybe even get a little lost as we embark on a journey of getting teams onboard with digital accessibility.

</DSWSession>

<DSWSession title="Common direction, boring magic" speakers={[speakers.SteveMesser]} organisation="GOV.UK">

Lessons from working on the GOV.‌UK Design System and other common platforms in UK government. How leaning on the principles that make the Web great can create more value for the public we serve.

</DSWSession>

## Organisation

Design Systems Week is organised by the NL Design System core team.

At NL Design System, web professionals from across the government collaborate on building blocks for websites and applications, like code, design and guidelines. The project is managed by ICTU for the Dutch Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations.
